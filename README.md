# SMS_Arduino
<p> Code for our Arduino SMS machine project.</p>

<p>Structure: All code for components is in the folder `/src/`. <strong>The `/src/main/` folder holds the code of the final project</strong> - as it is loaded onto the Arduino Mega. Important documents are stored in /docs.</p>

## Setup
- Setup your own Arduino Mega according to the wiring diagram.
- Copy libraries stored in `/src/libraries/` into the correct Arduino libraries folder.
  -  Details are in the `setup-info.md` file.
- Load the code stored in `/src/main/` onto the Arduino Mega.
- Start the Arduino and try it out.
