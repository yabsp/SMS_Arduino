# SMS_Arduino
Code for our Arduino SMS machine project.
Structure: All code for components is in the folder SMS_Arduino. There one creates a folder for each component and adds the source code files. Alternatively one can just put the source code directly into SMS_Arduino.
Root is for files other than source code.
